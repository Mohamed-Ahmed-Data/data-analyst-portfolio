# 🔄 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📁 Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their demographics, account status, and service usage. The goal is to help a telecom company identify high-risk customers and take proactive steps to improve retention.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for analysis)

## 🧠 Methods
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (e.g., encoding contract types)
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
- Confusion matrix, accuracy score, and ROC AUC evaluation

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Customers on month-to-month contracts were far more likely to churn.
- Long-tenure customers and those using fiber internet had distinct churn patterns.
- A simple logistic model correctly predicted ~80% of churn cases.

## 🧾 Dataset
- [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## 📈 Sample Output
_Add screenshots of confusion matrix, ROC curve, or key visuals here once the model is built._
