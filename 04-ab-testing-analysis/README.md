# 🧪 A/B Testing Analysis

## 📁 Project Overview
This project analyzes the results of an A/B marketing experiment to determine whether a new webpage version leads to a statistically significant increase in conversions. The goal is to help a digital marketing team make data-driven decisions.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, SciPy, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical analysis: t-tests and hypothesis testing

## 📊 Methods
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of control vs. treatment groups
- Two-sample t-test to compare conversion rates
- Confidence interval and p-value interpretation

## 🔍 Key Insights
- The new webpage version increased conversions by 4.3%
- However, the result was **not statistically significant at 95% confidence**
- Recommendation: conduct another experiment with a larger sample size

## 🧾 Dataset
- Simulated or open-source A/B test dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or Udacity)
