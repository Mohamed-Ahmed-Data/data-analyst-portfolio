# 🔍 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses a real-world telecom dataset to build a predictive model for customer churn. The goal is to help businesses identify customers likely to stop using their services so they can take proactive retention steps.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze customer behaviors and trends
- Identify patterns contributing to customer churn
- Build and evaluate a machine learning model using logistic regression
- Deliver actionable insights and performance metrics

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas, NumPy (data cleaning & prep)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (exploratory data analysis & visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (machine learning & model evaluation)

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- The churn rate was ~26.5%.
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** were far more likely to churn.
- Customers paying with **electronic check** had the highest churn rates.
- Higher **monthly charges** correlated with increased churn.
- After scaling, the logistic regression model achieved **~82% accuracy**.

## 🤖 Model Performance  
**Model used:** Logistic Regression  
**Accuracy:** ~82%  
**Precision (churn):** 68%  
**Recall (churn):** 60%  
**F1 Score (churn):** 64%  

> The model performs well at identifying likely churners, particularly after feature scaling.
